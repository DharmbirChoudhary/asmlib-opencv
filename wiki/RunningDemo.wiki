#summary How to run the demo

= Introduction =
"test/main.cpp" is a demo. After compilation, a executable "test" or "test.exe" should be generated. You may call it like:
{{{
./test -pc -m ../../../data/grayall_asm.model -f -C ../../../data/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml
}}}

or
{{{
./test -m ../../../data/grayall_asm.model -v
}}}

in which:
 *-f means fitting
 *-v means viewing the model

 *-p should be followed by the path of an image file, if given "c", it will use the webcam.
 *-C is the path to haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml
 *-m is the path to a model
 *-t asm means using asm

The model files are provided in the svn repository.
